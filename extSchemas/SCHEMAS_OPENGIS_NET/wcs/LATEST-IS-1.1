LATEST version is the M.N directory where 
 * M is the major version
 * N is the minor version
The latest bugfix version now is always in the M.N directory and 
documented in the version attribute on the schema element.

Previously the OGC used M.N.X where
 * M is the major version
 * N is the minor version
 * X is the bugfix (corrigendum) version
These will be left here for historical reasons.

	<gml:description> This document encodes timeseries.

		This uses a "generic" observation and sampling-features schema, based on the OGC OandM
		Parts 1 and 2 implemented as a GML-SF level 1 conformant XML Schema.

		This implementation assumes the existence of several identifier schemes, expressed as URIs -
		as indicated in comments below.

		The semantics of the groupings are provided more precisely by the links and cross-references
		embedded in the features. In this document the data is presented in a normalized form, with sites,
		locations, samples and	measurements all shown as "members" at the same level in the collection.
		The "nesting" of the various components is provided through typed links (relatedObservation,
		sampledFeature, relatedSamplingFeature) etc. The justification is that it is more flexible,
		and allows features to be effectively nested within various collections, rather than just
		one.

		The full GML "inline or by reference" pattern allows child features to be nested inline
		instead of using an xlink:href most places. However, deep nesting is not allowed by the
		GML-SF profile, which has been used here. While heterogeneous feature collections are
		permitted by the WFS standard, most implementations require multiple queries, one type at a
		time, to satisfy.  In this case the feature identifiers would have to be persistent and
		global, and all the cross-references would have to use full URLs rather than fragment
		identifiers (e.g. "#l1"). That implies a robust identifier management system.</gml:description>

				stream.  This would allow the more conventional codespace of
				http://www.bom.gov.au/std/water/xml/wio0.2/feature/TimeSeriesObservation/providerid/
				to be used.  The second option is only assign integers to observation streams of the same SamplingPoint,
				ObservedProperty and procedure.  In this case the codespace will need to be qualified by these (or an id
				equivalent) to retain the name value as an integer.  The second option is used below -->
